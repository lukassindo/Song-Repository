        <p>Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedes Benz ? 
	     My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends. 
	     Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends, 
	     So Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedes Benz ?</p> 
        <p>Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a color TV ? 
	     Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me. 
	     I wait for delivery each day until three, 
	     So oh Lord, won’t you buy me a color TV ?</p>
        <p>Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a night on the town ? 
              I’m counting on you, Lord, please don’t let me down. 
	      Prove that you love me and buy the next round, 
	      Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a night on the town ?</p>
	<p>Everybody! 
	      Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedes Benz ? 
	      My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends, 
	      Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends,
