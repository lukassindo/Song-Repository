    <h2>Janis Joplin</h2>
    <p>Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedes Benz ? 
	My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends. 
	Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends, 
	So Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedes Benz ?</p> 
    <p>Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a color TV ? 
	Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me. 
	I wait for delivery each day until three, 
	    So oh Lord, won’t you buy me a color TV ?</p>
    <p>Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a night on the town ? 
       I’m counting on you, Lord, please don’t let me down. 
	Prove that you love me and buy the next round, 
	Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a night on the town ?</p>
